# Eye tracker for playing visual novel

Visual novels (AVG) contain large amount of text. Each next line requires user inputting "enter", which can be tedius. Auto mode can solve the problem somewhat but user will have less flexiblity on controlling the pacing.

This repo aims to find developers who are interested in making an eye-tracking program which aids  the reading of visual novel. Essentially we want trigger `enter` just by moving our eyeballs.

# Stage 1 - Research

Currently we'd like to gather related information. Maybe there already exists some solution (commercial/open source). If we are to develop our own, what is the difficulty level? What are the requirements (e.g. the head should still be able to move slightly during the detection)? What eye gesture is good for triggering `enter`? There are quite a few areas which needs research. If you are intersted, please head towards the wiki and add your findings.
